# Local

If you want to try the game or experiment with the code in local, pull the repository and start a server in the root folder, where the index.html file is located. One of the ways to do this is with the command:

```python
python -m http.server
```

<b>Please note</b>: To enable sound and images in local you have to remove all the intances of the string `"final-project-lautzmayo/"` from the code.
